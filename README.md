FinnhubRB [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/finnhubrb.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/finnhubrb)
=========================================================

[Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/) is an API for retrieving Stock
market data in JSON or CSV format.
FinnhubRB is a wrapper Gem to use Finnhub with Ruby. FinnhubRB is based
on the [HTTP API of Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/docs/api).

To install FinnhubRB: `gem install finnhubrb`

To use it in your application: `require "finnhub"`

## How to test

To test the Gem create a config.yml file inside the folder /spec with inside a line

``` ruby
key: [YOUR KEY]
```

Then run "rspec spec/test_all.rb".

* This is a personal project, any stars for giving your support will make a man happy.

## Client

To contact Alpha Vantage you need to use a valid key that you can require from [here](https://finnhub.io/register).

To setup your clients use:

``` ruby
client = Finnhub::Client.new(key: "YOURKEY")
```

If you want to see the request that the client will do to Finnhub you can
setup verbose equal to true.

``` ruby
  client.verbose = true # You can setup this during the initialization too
```

## Stock

To analyse a stock you can start by choosing which stock exchange you want to analyse.

``` ruby
client.stock_exchanges # Retrieve the available stock exchanges on Finnhub (Finnhub::Stock_Exchange instances)
client.stock_exchanges(plain: true) # As above, but it returns simply the output of the request
stock_exchange = client.stock_exchanges(name: "NAME_CRYPTO_EXCHANGE") # Create a single instance of Finnhub::Stock_Exchange
```

After that you can choose in that crypto exchange which symbol you want to check.

``` ruby
stock_exchange.symbols # Retrieve the available stock symbols on the chosen stock exchange (Finnhub::Stock instances)
stock_exchange.symbols(plain: true) # As above, but it returns simply the output of the request
```

In alternative you can create a stock instance directly:.

``` ruby
stock = client.stock symbol: "AAPL"
```

Finnhub::Stock is used to manage a stock class.
Several methods are available under this class:

``` ruby
  stock.symbol # Return the symbol
  stock.profile # (PREMIUM) Retrieve profile of the stock
  stock.profile(isin: "US5949181045") # (PREMIUM) Retrieve profile of the stock by its isin
  stock.profile(cusip: "023135106") # (PREMIUM) Retrieve profile of the stock by its cusip
  stock.ceo_compensation # Retrieve compensation of the stock's CEO
  stock.executive # Retrieve list of company's executives
  stock.recommendation # Retrieve recommendation about this stock
  stock.price_target # Retrieve price target about this stock
  stock.upgrade_downgrade # Retrieve latest stock upgrade and downgrade
  stock.option_chain # Retrieve option chain about this stock
  stock.earnings # Retrieve earnings about this stock
  stock.metrics # Retrieve key metrics
  stock.investors # Retrieve full list of investors
  stock.funds # Retrieve list of fund investors
  stock.financials # (PREMIUM) Retrieve standardized balances sheet
  stock.news # Retrieve news about this stock (only US)
  stock.major_development # Retrieve major development
  stock.sentiment # Retrieve social sentiment about this stock (only US)
  stock.peers(plain: true) # Retrieve peers company similar to the one chosen
  stock.peers # Like the previous one, but the results are Finnhub::Stock instances
  stock.pattern # Retrieve pattern
  stock.support_resistance # Retrieve support resistance
  stock.technical_indicators # Retrieve technical indicators
  stock.revenue_estimate # Retrieve revenue estimate
  stock.earnings_estimate  # Retrieve earnings estimate
  stock.earnings_calendar # Retrieve earnings calendar (you can add from and to)
  stock.dividends(from: Time.now-24*30*3600, to: Time.now) # Retrieve dividends
  stock.splits(from: Time.now-24*30*3600, to: Time.now) # Retrieve splits
```

To create a timeseries you can use:

``` ruby
  stock.timeseries(count: 100) # Return the last 100 entries (default count is 100)
  stock.timeseries(resolution: "D") # Resolution is daily "D", alternative are 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, D, W, M) where the numeric one are for minutes (default resolution is "D")
  stock.timeseries(from: Time.now-24*30*3600, to: Time.now) # Fetch from a date to another date (default from: nil, to: nil)
  stock.timeseries(format: "json") # Return the output in json or in csv (default format: "json")
  stock.timeseries(adjusted: true) # Return adjusted data (default false)
```

Remember count and from/to are exclusive. If you use one, you cannot use the other two.
The methods "open", "high", "low", "close", "volume" and "status" will not work if you use format csv.

``` ruby
  timeseries = stock.timeseries(from: Time.now-24*30*3600, to: Time.now, resolution: 60)
  timeseries.output # Return output obtained from the request
  timeseries.timestamps # Return timestamps obtained from the request
  timeseries.open # Return open obtained from the request  
  timeseries.low # Return low obtained from the request
  timeseries.close # Return close obtained from the request
  timeseries.volume # Return volume obtained from the request
  timeseries.status # Return status obtained from the request  
```


(PREMIUM) To manage tick data use:

``` ruby
  tick = stock.tick(from: Time.now-24*30*3600, to: Time.now) # Create stick data
  tick.output # Return output obtained from the request
  tick.timestamps # Return timestamps obtained from the request
  tick.price  # Return price  obtained from the request
  tick.volume # Return volume obtained from the request
  tick.status # Return status obtained from the request  
```


(PREMIUM) To retrieve transcripts you can use:

``` ruby
client.transcripts # Retrieve the available transcripts on Finnhub (Finnhub::Transcript instances)
client.transcripts(plain: true) # As above, but it returns simply the output of the request
client.transcripts[0].transcript # Retrieve the specific transcript
```

To handle indicators you can do:
``` ruby
  timeseries = stock.indicator(from: Time.now-24*30*3600, to: Time.now, resolution: 60, indicator: "sma", args: {timeperiod: 3})
  timeseries.sma # Return technical values (in this case is sma since the indicator)
  timeseries.output # Return output obtained from the request
  timeseries.timestamps # Return timestamps obtained from the request
  timeseries.open # Return open obtained from the request  
  timeseries.low # Return low obtained from the request
  timeseries.close # Return close obtained from the request
  timeseries.volume # Return volume obtained from the request
  timeseries.status # Return status obtained from the request  
```

## Crypto

To analyse a crypto currency you should start by choosing which crypto exchange you want to analyse.

``` ruby
client.crypto_exchanges # Retrieve the available crypto exchanges on Finnhub (Finnhub::Crypto_Exchange instances)
client.crypto_exchanges(plain: true) # As above, but it returns simply the output of the request
crypto_exchange = client.crypto_exchange(name: "NAME_CRYPTO_EXCHANGE") # Create a single instance of Finnhub::Crypto_Exchange
```

After that you can choose, in that crypto exchange which symbol you want to check.

``` ruby
crypto_exchange.symbols # Retrieve the available crypto symbols on the chosen crypto exchange (Finnhub::Crypto_Symbol instances)
crypto_exchange.symbols(plain: true) # As above, but it returns simply the output of the request
crypto_symbol = crypto_exchange.symbol(symbol: "BTC") # Create a single instance of Finnhub::Crypto_Symbol
```

From crypto_symbol instance you can retrieve some interesting information.

``` ruby
crypto_symbol.exchange # Exchange of the crypto_symbol
crypto_symbol.hasWM # If it has week and month
crypto_symbol.displaySymbol # Displayed symbol
crypto_symbol.symbol # Symbol of the crypto currency
```

Furthermore you can create a timeseries with the same logic used for Stock timeseries.

``` ruby
  timeseries = crypto_symbol.timeseries(from: Time.now-24*30*3600, to: Time.now, resolution: 60)
  timeseries.output # Return output obtained from the request
  timeseris.timestamps # Return timestamps obtained from the request
